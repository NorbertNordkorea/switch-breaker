Break-in Machine in a 5x5 format for breaking in 100 switches

Work in progress

Designed to work with this motor: https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08WYPXN54/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 (you'll probably find it cheaper somewhere)

Requires two m4x10 screws, two m4 nuts, two needle bearrings HK0408 (https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07J3BTZ1T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), DC - USB-c adapter(https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08FD6381L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Rotating piece wears out easily when made out of PLA, PETG works better
